## Installation

Add to your project using `npm i -S react-journey`

## How to use

1. Wrap your application in the `JourneyProvider`. react-journey provides a `JourneyComponent` out of the box, but it is unstyled. You will most likely want to provide your own styled component in place of this.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { JourneyComponent, JourneyProvider } from 'react-journey';

ReactDOM.render(
  <JourneyProvider Component={JourneyComponent}>
    <App />
  </JourneyProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

2. Wrap any HTML that you want to include in the journey in a `JourneyStep`. You should provide a message prop for the step to show.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { JourneyStep } from 'react-journey';

const MyApp = () => (
  <JourneyStep message="Header">
    <p>A step in the journey!</p>
  </JourneyStep>
);
```

3. Call run on the journey to get it started, and stop if you want to stop it.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useJourney } from 'react-journey';

function App() {
  const { run, stop } = useJourney();

  useEffect(() => {
    run();
    return stop;
  });

  return (
    <p>My app</p>
  );
}
```

## Advanced use

You can use the `useStep` hook if you don't want to use the `JourneyStep` component. If you don't want to alter your HTML structure for example.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useJourney } from 'react-journey';

function App() {
  const { useStep } = useJourney();
  const el = useRef(null);
  useStep(el, 'This is the message for this element');

  return (
    <p ref={el}>My app</p>
  );
}
```

You can manually register‚Äîand unregister‚Äîelements from the tour if you don't want to use the `JourneyStep` component or the `useStep` hook. If you don't want to alter your HTML structure for example.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useJourney } from 'react-journey';

function App() {
  const { register, unRegister } = useJourney();
  const el = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const { current } = el;
    register(current, 'This is the message for this element');
    return () => unRegister(current);
  }, [register, unRegister]);

  return (
    <p ref={el}>My app</p>
  );
}
```
