# Contributions üòÅ

All contributions are welcome, and actively encouraged! Have a look at the steps below, but also please don't hesitate to get in contact if you are unsure what to do.

## Steps
1. Checkout the project.
2. Create a new branch off `develop`.
3. Make your change (including tests).
4. Commit your work. Commit messages follow [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax (there is a pre-commit hook to help with this).
5. Push your branch to origin.
6. Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch.
7. Once merged in to master the new version will be automatically built, and pushed to npm.
